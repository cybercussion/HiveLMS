HiveLMS

About:
This started off as a side project for multi devices, but the goal is to eventually get full "typical" support for ingesting proprietary and SCORM 2004 content.
Targets - iOS devices, Android, Safari, FireFox, Chrome and IE8+ 

As of 12-5-2010, the base frame work of the UI and the backend is laid out.  Some of the top items on my list  - 

- Finish SCORM 2004 API
- Graphic updates for mobile (smaller graphics)
- Rethink the Assignments/Lessons menus a bit.  This blurred a bit on me as I was designing it.  I'd like to do something new and take a very minimalist approach to it.  Very tired of being over saturated with information among other LMS's.

More to come ...
